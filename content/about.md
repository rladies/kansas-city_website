# R-Ladies Global

**R-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote Gender Diversity in the R community.**

The R community suffers from an underrepresentation of minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) in every role and area of participation, whether as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference participants, educators, or users ([see recent stats](http://forwards.github.io/data/)).

As a diversity initiative, the mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladiesâ€™ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting minority gender R enthusiasts to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.

# Kansas City Chapter

The Kansas City MO/KS chapter was founded in August 2019. The global R-Ladies team received three inquiries about a chapter in the KC area at three different times, and it connected the three founding members (Gabi, Anya, and Boryana) via email.
