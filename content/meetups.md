## [Nerding Out: An R-Ladies Social](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-kansas-city/events/265215598/)

Date: 10/16/2019

Come join R Ladies for our first social event. We will start the evening with announcements of happenings in the local and global R community and a mix of structured group activities to get to know each other better. Then, in the spirit of show and tell, Anya, Boryana, and Gabi will then provide short presentations of cool topics they learned in R that week and open up the floor for others to share as well.

Look for us in the reserved space in the back of the restaurant. Feel free to bring a laptop and a friend. All skill levels are welcome!
